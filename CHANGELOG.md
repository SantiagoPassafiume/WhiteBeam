## [Unreleased]

### Added

- N/A

## [0.2.2] - 2021-05-12

### Added

- Linux LD_PRELOAD/LD_AUDIT library: Support for 10 hooks

### Security
- The fopen/fopen64/truncate hooks (included in the Essential whitelist) allowed a file to be truncated in the OpenFileDescriptor action prior to the VerifyCanWrite action. This allowed arbitrary files to be truncated with sufficient privileges on Linux, including WhiteBeam startup files.
  Further, the FORTIFY_SOURCE variants of libc functions, truncate64, and ftruncate64 may have allowed similar bypasses to be possible.
  Fixed in 0.2.2: https://github.com/WhiteBeamSec/WhiteBeam/security/advisories/GHSA-3f8r-9483-pfxj
